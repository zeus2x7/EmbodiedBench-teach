# Exclude simulator binaries if they are too large (user can mount them or we copy specifically)
# But we need them inside if we want it to be "shift directly"
# The user said "containerize the entire project"
# So I should probably INCLUDE the simulators if they are in the folder.
# But I should exclude large datasets if possible.
